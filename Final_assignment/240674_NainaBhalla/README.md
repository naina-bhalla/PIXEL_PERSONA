The model identifies faces in an image using Haar Cascades and then classifies the faces into either male or female.
(The final model that I have submitted can only be run on a local runtime.)

## Overview
### Dataset
It uses a dataset with 900 images in the training dataset and 200 each in the testing and the validation set. Each of the sets have 50% male images and 50% female images.

Since the dataset that I had used had no labels with the images, just were in separate labelled folders, I added labels to them when I created DataFrames for the dataset.

I preprocessed the dataset images according to the model and encoded the labels using LabelEncoder

### Model Architecture
The model itself is composed of various layers including Conv2D,MaxPooling,BatchNormalization and Dropout. It also uses early stopping callbacks to prevent overfitting.

## Performance
The model gives 88.49% accuracy on the testing data and a loss of 0.30.

## Live Detetction
This part only runs on a local runtime using a jupyter notebook. It switches on the webcam and then detects the gender of the person on the live feed along with the probability of its prediction.
